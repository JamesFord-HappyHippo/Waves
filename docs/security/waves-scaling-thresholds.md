# Waves Marine Navigation - Scaling Thresholds & Levels
## Cost-Optimized Growth Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** August 21, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define exact triggers for infrastructure scaling based on real usage

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the precise thresholds for scaling the Waves marine navigation platform from friends & family testing ($25/month) to enterprise production ($2,000+/month). Each level is triggered by measurable metrics to ensure cost optimization while maintaining maritime safety standards.

**Philosophy:** Pay for what you actually need, scale when usage demands it.

## Upgrade Decision Framework

### Automatic Triggers (Upgrade Immediately)
- **Hard limits reached**: Database storage >95%, Lambda timeout errors >20%
- **Performance degradation**: API response times >5 seconds consistently
- **Security incidents**: Any security-related issue or concern raised

### Business Triggers (Plan Upgrade in 2-4 weeks)
- **User growth**: 80% of current level capacity reached
- **Commercial interest**: First inquiry from marina/charter/professional
- **Feature pressure**: Users requesting features that require next level

### Optional Triggers (Consider Upgrade)
- **Cost efficiency**: Sometimes higher tier is more cost-effective
- **Reliability needs**: Users expressing concern about downtime
- **Competitive pressure**: Other solutions offering features you can't

---

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Stay in Lower Tier Longer
- **Implement caching** to reduce database load
- **Optimize queries** to handle more users on smaller instance
- **User education** about peak usage times
- **Feature limiting** for non-essential functionality

### Smart Upgrades
- **Partial upgrades**: Upgrade only constrained components
- **Regional deployment**: Start in one region, expand based on demand
- **Reserved instances**: Once usage is predictable, commit to reserved pricing

---

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Upgrade Planning
- [ ] Monitor metrics for 2 weeks to confirm sustained need
- [ ] Estimate new monthly costs vs current usage
- [ ] Plan deployment timeline and testing
- [ ] Communicate changes to users (if applicable)
- [ ] Document rollback procedures

### During Upgrade
- [ ] Deploy new infrastructure in parallel
- [ ] Test with subset of traffic
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Validate all features working
- [ ] Update monitoring thresholds

### Post-Upgrade
- [ ] Monitor costs vs predictions
- [ ] Gather user feedback on performance
- [ ] Optimize new infrastructure
- [ ] Plan next level thresholds
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Emergency Procedures

### Unexpected Usage Spike
1. **Immediate**: Check if spike is legitimate or attack
2. **Scale**: Temporarily over-provision to handle load
3. **Analyze**: Determine if permanent upgrade needed
4. **Optimize**: Right-size infrastructure based on sustained usage

### Cost Spike Alert
1. **Immediate**: Check for misconfiguration or runaway processes
2. **Limit**: Implement temporary usage caps if needed
3. **Investigate**: Identify root cause of increased costs
4. **Optimize**: Adjust infrastructure or usage patterns

**Document Maintenance:**
- Review monthly during development phase
- Update quarterly once stabilized
- Annual comprehensive review
- Adjust thresholds based on actual growth patterns
