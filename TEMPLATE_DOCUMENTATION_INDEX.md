## 📞 Getting Help

### Documentation Issues
If any documentation is unclear:
1. Check if there's a more specific file for your use case
2. Look in `.clinerules/` for detailed patterns
3. Reference Tim-Combo patterns for advanced examples

### Agent System Issues
If agents aren't working properly:
1. Run `node initialize-project.js` to check system status
2. Verify `.adrian/agent-memory-manager.js` is working
3. Check individual agent state files in `.adrian/agents/`

### Development Issues
If you're stuck on implementation:
1. Use the planner agent to break down complex tasks
2. Reference the appropriate `.clinerules/` standards
3. Ask the researcher agent for best practices
