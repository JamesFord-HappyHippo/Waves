```sql
calculate_depth_quality_score(confidence, validator_present, equipment_type, user_experience, gps_accuracy)
```
- Weighs multiple factors for overall quality score
- Accounts for equipment type and user expertise
- Penalizes poor GPS accuracy
- Rewards professional validation

### Hazard Identification
```sql  
identify_hazard_areas(min_depth_threshold, confidence_threshold)
```
- Automatically detects shallow water hazards
- Groups readings by geographic grid
- Requires multiple confirmations
- Classifies by risk level (critical/high/moderate/low)

### User Performance Metrics
```sql
calculate_user_performance_metrics(user_id)
```
- Tracks contribution patterns and accuracy
- Calculates validation rates and consistency
- Identifies areas of expertise (shallow/deep/general)
- Supports reputation scoring

### System Monitoring Views
- **marine_data_summary**: Overall system statistics
- **data_quality_metrics**: Quality breakdown by user type
- **public_depth_readings**: Curated public data view
- **depth_readings_with_areas**: Readings with area context

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Loading Test Data
```bash
# Load with validation
node backend/database/scripts/load_test_data.js --validate

# Force reload in test environment  
node backend/database/scripts/load_test_data.js --environment=test --force

# Generate additional readings if needed
node backend/database/scripts/load_test_data.js --environment=dev --force --validate --verbose
```

### SQL Query Examples

#### Get High-Quality Recent Readings
```sql
SELECT * FROM public_depth_readings 
WHERE confidence > 0.9 
  AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND safety_category != 'shallow'
ORDER BY validation_score DESC;
```

#### Find Shallow Water Hazards
```sql
SELECT * FROM identify_hazard_areas(12.0, 0.8)
WHERE hazard_level IN ('critical', 'high')
ORDER BY average_depth ASC;
```

#### User Performance Analysis
```sql
SELECT * FROM calculate_user_performance_metrics('user-uuid-here');
```

#### Active Safety Alerts by Region
```sql  
SELECT alert_type, severity, title, description
FROM safety_alerts 
WHERE is_active = TRUE
  AND start_time <= NOW() 
  AND (end_time IS NULL OR end_time > NOW())
ORDER BY severity DESC, start_time DESC;
```
